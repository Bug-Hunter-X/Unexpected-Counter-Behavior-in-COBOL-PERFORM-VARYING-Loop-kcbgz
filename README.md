This repository contains a simple COBOL program demonstrating a potential issue with the PERFORM VARYING statement.  The program initializes a counter to zero and iterates a loop ten times.  The issue lies in how some COBOL compilers handle the termination condition and the starting value of the index. This can cause unexpected counter values in the output.  The solution provided fixes this issue by correcting the loop's initialization and/or boundary condition.
